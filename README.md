# TicTacToe

## Description
Design and build a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe program. You can make the interface however you would like it (a simple text interface where the board is redrawn after each move is probably the easiest). The basic features of the program are as follows:
	• Display the board
	• Get a players move (of course make sure that the position is empty)
	• A referee should check so see if the game is over. This can happen one of two ways.
		o A player wins
		o All of the positions are filled and there is no winner (ie a draw)

We know that after each player moves the referee needs to evaluate the board to see
if the game is over. Let's make the referee feature an Aspect.
