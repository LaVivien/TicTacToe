# TicTacToe

## Description
Design and build a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe program. The basic features of the program are as follows:

-	You need to design a program to make a tic tac toe game. 
-	You must make the program run as an object. The board should be a default of 3X3 but can be made larger when a new object is made. 
-	You must have a two player game that keeps track of the player turn and won’t let a player go twice in a row. 
-	You must print out each move into the terminal after each turn so the players can see the open squares. 
-	If a square is taken already, you should tell the user they need to try again so squares are not overwritten.
-	Separate the squares so each area is identifiable. 
-	The terminal should look like this.
